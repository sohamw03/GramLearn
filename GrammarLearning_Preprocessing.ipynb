One is a de luxe edition, illustrated in full-colour, and the  other is an ordinary edition without illustrations.  \\nThe material in the book has been further updated where called for. It has been felt  necessary in particular to revise some material in the chapters dealing with adjectives,  active and passive voice, articles and prepositions. Appendix I, which deals with  American English, has been expanded. Appendix II has been replaced with a newer set of  tests covering the important areas of grammar.  \\nIt was in the year 1972 that the shrewd visionary Mr. Shyam Lai Gupta obtained the permission of Manecji Cooper Education Trust for the revision of this book and commissioned me to revise it thoroughly. The revised edition came out in 1973 and was well received. One of the main features of the revised edition was the addition of a great deal of new material (such as the three chapters on structures) based on the new developments in the study of English structure and usage. Subsequently the book was revised every four or five years and most extensively in 1999.  \\nUnlike many traditional grammar books, the book in the present form helps the student to use the language as well as giving detailed information about the language. It provides  ample guidance and practice in sentence building, correct usage, comprehension, written composition and other allied areas so as to equip the student with the ability to  communicate effectively in English.  \\nIt is gratifying to learn that this classic work, though primarily intended for use in the  Indian subcontinent, is also used in Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Singapore, Mauritius, etc. It is  hoped that the book will be found useful in many more countries where English is used as  a second or foreign language.\"),\n",

              " Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'PARTS OF SPEECH'}, page_content='8. Words are divided into different kinds or classes, called Parts of Speech, according to their use; that is, according to the work they do in a sentence. The parts of speech are  eight in number:  \\n- 1. Noun.\\n- 2. Adjective.\\n- 3. Pronoun.\\n- 4. Verb.\\n- 5. Adverb.\\n- 6. Preposition.\\n- 7. Conjunction.\\n- 8. Interjection.\\n- 9. A Noun is a word used as the name of a person, place, or thing; as, Akbar was a great King.  \\nKolkata is on the Hooghly.  \\nThe rose smells sweet.  \\nThe sun shines bright.  \\nHis courage won him honour.  \\nNote: The word thing includes (i) all objects that we can see, hear, taste, touch, or smell; and (ii) something that we can think of, but cannot perceive by the senses.  \\n- 10. An Adjective is a word used to add something to the meaning of a noun; as, He is a brave boy.  \\nThere are twenty boys in this class.  \\n- 11. A Pronoun is a word used instead of a noun; as,  \\nJohn is absent, because he is ill.  \\nThe book are where you left them  \\nPage 4  \\n- 12. A Verb is a word used lo express an action or state; as  \\nThe girl wrote a letter to her cousin.  \\nKolkata is a big city.  \\nIron and copper are useful metals. - 13. An Adverb is a word used to add something to the meaning of a verb, an adjective, or another adverb; as,  \\nHe worked the sum quickly. This flower is very beautiful. She pronounced the word quite correctly.  \\n- 14. A Preposition is a word used with a noun or a pronoun to show how the person or thing denoted by the noun or pronoun stands in relation to something else; as,  \\nThere is a cow in the garden.  \\nThe girl is fond of music.  \\nA fair little girl sat under a tree.  \\n- 15. A Conjunction is a word used to join words or sentences; as,  \\nRama and Hari are cousins.  \\nTwo and two make four.  \\nI ran fast, but missed the train.  \\n16. An Interjection is a word which expresses some sudden feel ing; as, Hurrah! We have won the game. Alas! She is dead.  \\n- 17. Some modern grammars include determiners among the parts of speech. Determiners  are words like a, an, the, this, that, these, those, every, each, some, any, my, his, one, two,  etc., which determine or limit the meaning of the nouns that follow. In this book, as in  many traditional grammars, all determiners except a, an and the are classed among  adjectives.\\n- 18. As words are divided into different classes according to the work they do in  sentences, it is clear that we cannot say to which part of speech a word belongs unless we  see it used in a sentence.  \\nThey arrived soon after. (Adverb)  \\nThey arrived after us. (Preposition)  \\nThey arrived after we had left. (Conjunction)  \\nFrom the above examples we see that the same word can be used as different parts of speech.'),\n",

A Noun is a word used as the name of a person, place or thing.  \\nNote: The word thing is used to mean anything that we can think of.  \\n20. Look at the following sentence:  \\nAsoka was a wise king.  \\nThe noun Asoka refers to a particular king, but the noun king might be applied to any  other king as well as to Asoka. We call Asoka a Proper Noun, and king a Common Noun. Similarly:  \\nSita is a Proper Noun, while girl is a Common Noun.  \\nHart is a Proper Noun, while boy is a Common Noun.  \\nKolkata is a Proper Noun, while city is a Common Noun.  \\nIndia is a Proper Noun, while country is a Common Noun.  \\nThe word girl is a Common Noun, because it is a name common to all girls, while Sita is  a Proper Noun because it is the name of a particular girl.  \\nDef. - A Common Noun is a name given in common to every person or thing of the same class or kind.  \\n[Common here means shared by all.]  \\nDef. - A Proper Noun is the name of some particular person or place, [Proper means one's own. Hence a Proper Name is a person's own name.]  \\nNote 1 - Proper Nouns are always written with a capital letter at the beginning.  \\nNote 2 - Proper Nouns are sometimes used as Common Nouns; as,  1. He was the Lukman (= the wisest man) of his age.  \\n2. Kalidas is often called the Shakespeare (= the greatest dramatist) of India.  \\nCommon Nouns include what are called Collective Nouns and Abstract Nouns  \\nPage 6  \\n- 21. A Collective Noun is the name of a number (or collection) of persons or things taken together and spoken of as one whole; as,  \\nCrowd, mob, team, flock, herd, army, fleet, jury, family, nation, parliament, committee.  \\nA fleet = a collection of ships or vessels.  \\nAn army = a collection of soldiers.  \\nA crowd = a collection of people.  \\nThe police dispersed the crowd.  \\nThe French army was defeated at Waterloo.  \\nThe jury found the prisoner guilty.  \\nA herd of cattle is passing.  \\n- 22. An Abstract Noun is usually the name of a quality, action, or state considered apart from the object to which it belongs; as.  \\nQuality - Goodness, kindness, whiteness, darkness, hardness, brightness, honesty, wisdom, bravery.  \\nAction - Laughter, theft, movement, judgment, hatred.  \\nState - Childhood, boyhood, youth, slavery, sleep, sickness, death, poverty.  \\nThe names of the Arts and Science (e.g., grammar, music, chemistry, etc.) are also Abstract Nouns.  \\n[We can speak of a brave soldier, a strong man, a beautiful flower. But we can also think  of these qualities apart from any particular person or thing, and speak of bravery,  strength, beauty by themselves. So also we can speak of what persons do or feel apart  from the persons themselves, and give it a name. The word abstract means drawn off.]\"),\n",

Another classification of nouns is whether they are 'countable' or 'uncountable'. Countable nouns (or countables) are the names of objects, people, etc. that we can count, e.g., book, pen, apple, boy, sister, doctor, horse.  \\nUncountable nouns (or uncountables) are the names of things which we cannot count,  e.g., milk, oil, sugar, gold, honesty.

The first word of each pair is the name of a male animal. The second word of each pair is the name of a female animal. A noun that denotes a male animal is said to be of the Masculine Gender.

The moon has hidden her face behind a cloud. Spring has spread her mantle of green over the earth. Peace hath her victories no less renowned than war.  \\nThis use is most common in poetry but certain nouns are personified in nrose too.

Some nouns originally singular are now generally used in the plural; as, Alms, riches, eaves.  \\nRiches do many things.  \\n- 37. The following nouns look plural but are in fact singular:\\n- (1) Names of subjects  \\nmathematics, physics, electronics, etc.  \\n- (2) The word news\\n- (3) Names of some common diseases measles, mumps, rickets\\n- (4) Names of some games  \\nbilliards, draughts  \\nMathematics is his favourite study.  \\nNo news is good news.  \\nIndia won by an innings and three runs.  \\nMeasles is infectious. Billiards is my favourite game.  \\n- 'Means' is used either as singular or plural. But when it has the meaning of 'wealth' it is always plural; as,  \\nHe succeeded by this means (or, by these means) in passing the examination.  \\nHis means are small, but he has incurred no debt.  \\n- 38. Certain Collective Nouns, though singular in form, are always used as plurals; as,\\n- 39. A Compound Noun generally forms its plural by adding -s to the principal word; as,  \\nPoultry, cattle, vermin, people, gentry.  \\nThese poultry are mine.  \\nWhose are these cattle?  \\nVermin destroy our property and carry disease.  \\nWho are those people (= persons)?  \\nThere are few gentry in this town.  \\nNote:- As a Common Noun 'people' means a 'nation' and is used in both singular and plural; as,  \\nThe Japanese are a hard-working people.  \\nThere are many different peoples in Europe.\"),\n",

It is usual to say  \\nThe Miss Smiths. (Singular, Miss Smith.)  \\n47. Abstract Nouns have no plural. They are uncountable.  \\nHope, charity, love, kindness.  \\nWhen such words do appear in the plural, they are used as countables; as  \\nProvocations = instances or cases of provocation.  \\nKindnesses = acts of kindness.  \\nNames of substances are also uncountables and are not therefore used in the plural.

The horse kicked the boy.  \\nIn sentence 1, the noun John is the Subject. It is the answer to the question, 'Who threw a stone?'  \\nThe group of words threw a stone is the Predicate.  \\nThe Predicate contains the verb threw.  \\nWhat did John throw?-A stone. Stone is the object which John threw. The noun stone is therefore called the Object.  \\nIn sentence 2, the noun horse is the Subject. It is the answer to the question, 'Who kicked  the boy?'  \\nThe noun boy is the Object. It is the answer to the question, 'Whom did the horse kick?'  \\n- 49. When a noun (or pronoun) is used as the Subject of a verb, it is said to be in the Nominative Case.  \\nPage 16  \\nWhen a noun (or pronoun) is used as the Object of a verb, it is said to be in the Objective  (or Accusative) Case.  \\nNote-To find the Nominative, put Who? or What? before the verb.  \\nTo find the Accusative put, Whom? or What? before the verb and its subject.  \\n50. A noun which comes after a preposition is also said to be in the Accusative Case; as, The book is in the desk.  \\nThe noun desk is in the Accusative Case, governed by the preposition in.  \\n- 51. Read the following sentences:-  \\nHari broke the window. (Object)  \\nThe window was broken. (Subject)  \\nIt will be seen that Nouns in English have the same form for the Nominative and the Accusative.  \\nThe Nominative generally comes before the verb, and the Accusative after the verb. Hence they are distinguished by the order of words, or by the sense.  \\n- 52. Compare:-\\n- 1. Rama gave a ball.\\n- 2. Rama gave Hari a ball.  \\nIn each of these sentences the noun ball is the Object of gave. In the second sentence we are told that Hari was the person to whom Rama gave a ball.  \\nThe noun Hari is called the Indirect Object of the verb gave.  \\nThe noun ball, the ordinary Object, is called the Direct Object.  \\nIt will be noticed that the position of the Indirect Object is immediately after the verb and before the Direct Object.  \\nNote:  \\nRama gave Hari a ball = Rama gave a ball to Hari.  \\nWill you do me a favour? = Will you do a favour to me?  \\nI bought Rama a ball = I bought a ball for Rama.  \\nFetch the boy a book = Fetch a book for the boy.  \\nShe made Ruth a new dress = She made a new dress for Ruth.  \\nGet me a taxi = Get a taxi for me.  \\nWe see that the Indirect Object of a verb denotes the person to whom something is given,  or for whom something is done.  \\n53. Examine the sentence:-  \\nThis is Ram's umbrella.  \\nRam's umbrella = the umbrella belonging to Rama.  \\nThe form of the noun Rama is changed to Rama's to show ownership of possession. The Noun Rama's is therefore said to be in the possessive (or Genitive) Case Page 17  \\nThe Possessive answers the question, 'Whose?'  \\nWhose umbrella? - Rama's.  \\n54. The Possessive Case does not always denote possession. It is used to denote authorship, origin, kind, etc. as,  \\nShakespeare's plays = the plays written by Shakespeare.  \\nA mother's love = the love felt by a mother.  \\nThe President's speech = the speech delivered by the President.  \\nMr. Aggarwal's house = the house where Mr. Aggarwal lives.  \\nAshok's school = the school where Ashok goes.  \\nA children's playground = a playground for children.  \\nA week's holiday = a holiday which lasts a week.\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'Formation of the Possessive Case'}, page_content=\"55. (1) When the noun is Singular, the Possessive Case is formed by adding 's to the noun; as,  \\nThe boy's book; the king's crown.  \\nNote:- The letter s is omitted in a few words where too many hissing sounds would come together; as,  \\nFor conscience' sake; for goodness' sake;  \\nFor justice' sake; for Jesus' sake; Moses' laws. - (2) When the noun is Plural, and ends in s, the Possessive Case is formed by adding only  an apostrophe; as,  \\nBoys' school; girls' school; horses' tails.  \\n- (3) When the noun is Plural but does not end in s, the Possessive sign is formed by adding 's as,  \\nMen's club; children's books.  \\n- 56. When a noun or a title consists of several words, the Posses sive sign is attached only  to the last word; as,  \\nThe King of Bhutan's visit.  \\nThe Prime Minister of Mauritius's speech.  \\n- 57. When two nouns are in apposition, the possessive sign is put to the latter only; as, That is Tagore the poet's house.\\n- 58. Also when two nouns are closely connected, the possessive is put to the latter; as, Karim and Salim's bakery.  \\nWilliam and Mary's reign.  \\n59. Each of two or more connected nouns implying separate possession must take the possessive sign; as,  \\nRaja Rao's and R.K. Narayan's novels.  \\nGoldsmith's and Cowper's poems.\"),\n",
              " Document(metadata={'Header 2': 'Use of the Possessive Case'}, page_content=\"60. The Possessive Case is now used chiefly with the names of living thing; as, The Governor's bodyguard; the lion's mane.  \\nPage 18  \\nSo we must say:  \\nThe leg of the table [not, the table's leg]. The cover of the book [not, the book's cover]. The roof of the house [not, the house's roof).  \\n- 61. But the Possessive is used with the names of personified (When n inanimate thing has ascribed to it the attributes of a person it is said to be personified. (See § 28)) objects; as, India's heroes; Nature's laws; Fortune's favourite; at duty's call; at death's door.\\n- 62. The Possessive is also used with nouns denoting time, space or weight; as,  A day's march; a week's holiday; in a year's time; a stone's throw; a foot's length; a pound's weight.\\n- 63. The following phrases are also in common use:At his fingers' ends; for mercy's sake; to his heart's content; at his wit's end; a boat's crew.\\n- 64. The possessive of a proper name or of a noun denoting a trade, profession, or  relationship may be used to denote a building or place of business (church, house, school,  college, shop, hospital, the atre; etc.) as,  \\nShe has gone to the baker's ( = baker's shop). Tonight I am dining at my uncle's ( = uncle's house). Can you tell me the way to St .Paul's ( ='St. Paul's church)? I attend the Town High School but my cousin attends St. Xavier's. He was educated ai St. Joseph's.  \\n- 65. When you are in doubt whether to use a noun in the possessive case or with the preposition of, remember that, as a general rule, the possessive case is used to denote possession or ownership. Thus it is better to say 'the defeat of the enemy' than 'the enemy's defeat', even though no doubt as to the meaning would arise.  \\nSometimes, however, a noun in the possessive case has a different meaning from a noun used with the preposition of; as,  \\n- 'The Prime Minister's reception in Delhi' means a reception held by the Prime Minister in Delhi.\\n- 'The reception of the Prime Minister in Delhi' means the manner in which the people welcomed him when he entered Delhi.  \\nThe phrase 'the love of a father' may mean either 'a father's love of his child' or 'a child's love of his father'.\"),\n",

Read the following sentence:-  \\nRama, our captain, made fifty runs.  \\nWe see that Rama and our captain are one and the same person. The noun captain follows  the noun Rama simply to explain which Rama is referred to.  \\nPage 19  \\nWhen one noun follows another to describe it, the noun which follows is said to be in apposition to the noun which comes before it.  \\n[Apposition means placing near.]  \\nA noun in apposition is in the same case as the noun which it explains.  \\nIn the above sentence the noun captain is in apposition to the noun Rama, and is in the Nominative Case (because Rama is in the Nominative Case.)  \\nFurther examples:-  \\n- 1. Kabir, the great reformer, was a weaver.\\n- 2. Yesterday I met your uncle, the doctor.\\n- 3. Have you seen Ganguli, the artist's drawings?  \\nIn sentence 1, the noun in apposition is in the Nominative Case. In sentence 2, the noun in apposition is in the Accusative Case.

Look at the following sentences:-\\n- 1. The lazy boy was punished.\\n- 2. The boy is lazy.  \\nIn sentence 1, the Adjective lazy is used along with the noun boy as an epithet or attribute. It is, therefore, said to be used Attributively.  \\nIn sentence 2, the Adjective lazy is used along with the verb is,  \\nPage 20  \\nand forms part of the Predicate.

Instead of saying 'Rama  is stronger than Balu we can say 'Balu is less strong than Rama'. Instead of saying 'Hari is  the laziest boy in the class', we can say 'Hari is the least industrious boy in the class7.  \\nNote 2:- The Superlative with most is sometimes used where there is no idea of comparison, but merely a desire to indicate the possession of a quality in a very high degree; as,  \\nThis is most unfortunate.  \\nIt was a most eloquent speech.  \\nTruly, a most ingenious device!  \\nThis usage has been called the Superlative of Eminence, or the Absolute Superlative.\"),\n",
